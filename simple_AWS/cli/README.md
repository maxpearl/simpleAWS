# Command Line Applications Using SimpleAWS

These command-line applications assume you DO have SimpleAWS installed in your virtual environment.

They are designed primarily as examples and utilities and hopefully they will be useful to you.

- simple_aws_inventory_sample.py allows you to inventory all resources (EC2, DynamoDB, S3, SNS and SQS) your account has access to in all regions your account has access to.
- More coming!

# Command Line Applications Using SimpleAWS

These command-line applications assume you DO NOT have SimpleAWS installed in your virtual environment.

They are designed primarily as examples and utilities and hopefully they will be useful to you.

- simple_aws_tests_sample.py is a sample file you can modify to your own specs to test functions (DynamoDB, S3, SNS, and SQS)
- simple_aws_inventory_sample.py allows you to inventory all resources (EC2, DynamoDB, S3, SNS and SQS) your account has access to in all regions your account has access to.
- More coming!

# Command Line Tests Using SimpleAWS

These command-line tests assume you DO NOT have SimpleAWS installed in your virtual environment.

They are designed to be used to test the functions during development.

- simple_aws_tests_sample.py is a sample file you can modify to your own specs to test functions (DynamoDB, S3, SNS, and SQS)

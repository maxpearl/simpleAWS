# Contributing to Simple-AWS

## Overview

I would love to have contributions to Simple-AWS. Whether it be bug fixes, test cases (need them!), new features, ideas, etc. Please feel free to post an issue, or make a pull request.

## Development Environment

### Local Testing

In /cli/ is a python script, simple_aws_tests_sample.py. It is an example of some tests you can run.
